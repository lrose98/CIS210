# CIS 211: Project 3
### Approximating Pi, Show Monte Pi, Fizzbuzz

**Learning Objectives:**
- Boolean data type; conditionals
- Designing, revising, and creating Python programs and functions
- Functions that return a non-None value and functions that return None; side effects
- Implemented a classic CIS problem
- Importing modules and functions from Python Standard Library (math, turtle, random)
- Monte Carlo methods, modeling, visualization
- Revising and creating Python functions
- Practice with Python Boolean data type, conditional statements, and repeat understanding, creating, implementing algorithms
- Understanding, creating, implementing algorithms

#### Fizzbuzz
###### p31_fizzbuzz.py
Counting up from 1, multiple of 3 are fizz, multiples of 5 are buzz, multiples of 3 and 5 are fizzbuzz

## Approximating Pi
###### p32_papproxpi.py
Approximate pi using the Monte Carlo method

## Approximating Pi
###### p33_showpi.py
Visually display the Monte Carlo method
