# CIS 211: Project 2
### Approximate Square Root, Draw Flower, Net Pay

**Learning Objectives:**

- Understanding, creating, implementing algorithms
- Accumulator pattern
- A function that calls other (user-defined) function (that returns a value)
- Functions that return a non-None value and functions that return None; side effects
- Good programming style (e.g., docstrings, constants)
- Importing modules
- Python graphics module (turtle graphics)
- Understanding, creating, implementing algorithms
